# YASPET : Angular Edition

Yet Another Starter Pack for Electron & Typescript ( aka YASPET ) 

YASPET is a starter pack with :

- Electron 4.
- Typescript 3 for main process.

This edition come with all the Angular Framework tooling. 

Only one tool was added on this project : Nodemon to reload the main process during development.

Unlike [React Edition of YASPET](https://github.com/ravidhu/yaspet-react), the package manager is NPM for this edition. That is simply because the "Getting Start" of Angular use it to install @angular/cli.

Of course, feel free to change the package manager and choose the one you like ;) 

## Getting Started

You can git clone this repository or download a zip of this repository to start coding.

### Installing

After getting the project, you need to install all packages with :

`npm install`

After that, you start coding and enable auto reloading for front and back with :

`npm run dev`

You run tests for front and back with ;

`npm run test`
